##Introduction

The purpose of this post is two fold: I want to practice my writings skills and I wanted to test drive the Markdown language due to the surprising difficulty in finding decent word processing alternatives. Currently I am utilizing an [online editor] since my default option, Sublime Text, doesn't have the most convenient workflow. That said, Sublime Text has been excellent for my small Python ventures.

It might go without saying that I also would like spread to  *some* of my ~~obsession~~ passion to whoever reads this.

A small word of caution: I am neither a good writer nor the most knowledgeable **[soccer]** fan (**football** shall be used exclusively to describe the sport that involves oversized men, an oblong shapped ball, and is played actively outside of Australia) so please take the points presented with a grain of salt while not being *too* harsh.

##Background
---
To start off, [Major League Soccer] (MLS) is the United States' top level professional soccer league. It was founded shortly after the 1994 World Cup and, more importantly, after the previous league folded from bankruptcy which, will be a story for another time. Instead i'm going to focus on the weird and intricate aspects of the league that distinguish it from other leagues across the world and why I came to love it.

I began watching MLS frequently after the 2014 World Cup where the U.S. had a decent run through the Group Stages; only advancing thanks to Portugal beating Ghana just to lose to Belgium. I lost interest shortly afterward due to the fact that there were few dark horses and difficulty in watching the matches live. What maintained my intersest was a series of articles written by [Five Thirty Eight] a sorta news blog focused on using statistics alongside analytics. 

Once it ended I couldn't help but think that this soccer thing was pretty interesting and decided to dive in. I quickly learned that choosing a league to follow can be pretty hard. You might say "Just choose the best one! The Brits and the Krauts are the best!" but the problem lies in a concept from relativistic physics called "Time Zones". So that pretty much limits my searchable to the other two continents with decent leagues.

##Structure

Right from the get go MLS decided to be weird, normally you have a number of teams and they all face each other in double round robin format with one home and one away game.

Simple, right? 

Well the problem is that the U.S. is pretty feakin' **HUGE**
